<h3>#5 Johnny Gaudreau</h3>
<img src="Johnny.jpeg" alt="Johnny Gaudrea Photo" style="width:300px;Height;300px;"> 
<p>Johnny was a drafted by Calgary in 2011 and was with the organization until just this year in 2022 when we decided to sigh with the Columbus Blue Jackets. Despite the abrupt leave Johnny was still a great hockey player to watch as a Flame. He would amaze with his great puck handling skills and was always a threat to score. </p>

<p>Robyn Regehr was drafted in 1998 by the Colorado Avalance but was trade to Calgary prior to his professional career began. He was a tough player and was apart of the Flames in a far more physical era of the sport. He was tenacious and defended him teammates with great physical play and as such was a delight to watch steamroll oppenents.</p>

<p>Dion Phaneuf was drafted by the Calgary flames in 2003 and was an abosolute dynamite to watch as he was a great combination of physical play and offense prowess. Although his career was short he spent most of his best year with Calgary and was exciting to watch.</p>

<h3>#1 Miikka Kiprusoff</h3>
<img src="Miikka.jpg" Alt="Miikka Kiprusoff Photo" Style="width:500px;height;500px;">
<p> Miikka Kiprusoff was drafted 116th overall in 1995 by the San Jose Sharks and was the starting goalie of the Flames when I watched my first season of hockey, he inspired me to become a goaltender myself and was a stoic presense for the stanley cup run of 2004. He was amazing to watch and truly in my opinion one of the greatest goalies to ever play for the Calgary Flames.</p>
