       <img src="Flames.png">
<p>The Calgary Flames went through a lot of off-season change but have shown that most of it has been for the better as they've started off the year 5-1-0 and have earned the NHL's top power ranking in the second week up from pre-season's 4th place ranking. Also they're my favourite team so I have a heavy bias for them to make the final four</p>

   <h1 class="TM"> Colorado Avalanche</h1>
   <img src="Avs.jpg">
   <p> The defending champions the Colorado Avalanche got slightly weaker in the off-season but are still a powerhouse team that I have sure will go far. The team is starting a little slower with some injuries to key players but are a shoe-in for the playoffs and I'm sure will make the final four with relative ease when at full strength.</p>

<div Class="Talk">
    <h1 class="TM"> Toronto Maple Leafs</h1>
    <img src="Leafs.jpg">
    <p>The Toronto Maple Leafs have had a hard time making it past the first round in recent years but constantly are improving and it is only a matter of time before a significant breakthrough. Last year's exit was particulary tough but this team is far too talented to be held down forever. I wouldn't be surprised to see the Leafs make a deep run this year!</p>
</div>
<div Class="Talk">
    <h1 class="TM"> Caronlina Hurricane</h1>
    <img src="Canes.jpg">
<p> The Carolina Hurricane may seem like an odd pick but I believe that they are a strong team that may be overlooked. Another young team that had a tough time in the playoffs last year mostly cause of injuries. If they can stay healthy and get some good goaltending their offense should be able to carry them far.</p>

<div class="footer"><h2>Of course this is all mere speculation by me at this time, and in regards to the Flames a hope for a deeper playoff run than one I've seen from them in years! Thanks for visiting!</h2>
